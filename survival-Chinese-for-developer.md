# Survival Chinese for developer

During [Coderetreat](index) or your work you may need to communicate with Chinese developer.
English level may vary, often it is passive, i.e. they can read well, but it is much harder to talk.
Be ready to hear some Chinese.
The good news is when looking at the same screen and talking over the code you write together,
it is not that hard, in fact quite joyful experience.

And knowing a few words would save some time and will help to break the ice.

## Minimal Vocabulary 最小的词汇

- 这个 Zhège this
- 这个是什么？Zhège shì shénme? What is this?
- 类 lèi class
- 方法 fāngfǎ method
- 单元测试 ānyuán cèshì unit test


Good luck! 祝你好运！ Zhù nǐ hǎo yùn！
